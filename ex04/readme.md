## My Atoi and Itoa

### Objectives
* Learn the C primitives types
* Learn how to use C pointers with Arrays of char
* Learn how to test your code

### Actions
* Go to the course directory `cd cep/courses/cunix/ex04/`
* Read all files in include/ src/ and the Makefile before starting anything
* Create files src/my_atoi.c src/my_itoa.c
* Implement atoi in a file called my_atoi using the prototype:
`int atoi(const char *nptr);`
* Implement itoa in a file called my_itoa using the prototype:
`char* my_itoa(int nmb);`
* Run `make test`
